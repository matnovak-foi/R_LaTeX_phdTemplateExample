The overall goal of this research is to :
\begin{itemize}
  \item[G1]: \textit{Goal 1}
  \item[G2]: \textit{Goal 2.}

From the goals the following hypotheses emerge:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[H1]: \textit{Hip 1}
  \item[H2]: \textit{Hip 2}
\end{itemize}
Since G2 is partially fulfilled by H2 the rest is covered by the following research question:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[Q1]: \textit{Queston}
\end{itemize}

The rest of the thesis is structured as follows. In Chapter \ref{ch:relatedwork}, related work is described including short sections describing ... Chapter \ref{ch:methodology} ... Conclusion \ref{ch:conclusion} concludes. \cite{ottenstein1976, leach1995}
